  Retrieve an overall representation of a person's onboarding check status, which is determined by the statuses of all their [onboarding checks](/api/reference/operation/createOnboardingChecks).<br><br>If a single onboarding check has failed, the person's overall onboarding check status will be `FAILED`. If no checks have failed, but some checks are not complete, the overall status will be `PENDING`.<br><br>Returns both the overall onboarding check status and a list showing each onboarding check and its status.
