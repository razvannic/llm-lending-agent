  Install
  
  The Mobile Api's uses javascript code to generate private and public keys which you need to register a new device and sign your request messages.
  
  In the root of this collection 'Mobile Api', you need to install packages within the `package.json` file, run:
  
  `npm install`
  
  You also need to add `scripts.moduleWhitelist` to your bruno.json.
  
  Here is an example:
  
  ```
  {
    "version": "1",
    "name": "Mobile Api",
    "type": "collection",
    "ignore": [
      "node_modules",
      ".git"
    ],
    "scripts": {
      "moduleWhitelist": [
        "node-rsa"
      ]
    }
  }
  ```
  
  The last thing you would need to do is change your mode from `Safe` to `Developer`
}
